# Hello there!👋
I’m Sai, and I hold a Master’s degree in Business Analytics! My passion lies at the intersection of data, technology, and creativity, and I’m always excited to learn new things and take on challenging projects.

🌱 What I’m Learning: I’m diving deep into Deep Reinforcement Learning and exploring its potential in solving complex problems.

👀 Interests: I’m a huge sports enthusiast and love staying active.

🎾 Fun Fact: I used to be a professional Tennis player, and I bring the same determination and discipline from the court to everything I do.

🎮 Gamer at Heart: I love playing video games—recently, I conquered Elden Ring and now I’m competing in Apex Legends!

⚽ I’m also a die-hard Arsenal FC fan, and my ultimate dream is to one day own the club!

📖 The book I am currently reading is The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany.

This post features me modeling for a Tax Workshop! It was an exciting opportunity to combine creativity while contributing to promoting financial awareness!🧍‍♂️
